<h1>React.js + Typescript 2D Soft-Body Simulator</h1>

<p>
This is the beginnings of a soft-body simulator I'm working on as an exercise in learning React.js as well as Typescript. This project's design is based on lessons learned in a previous physics sim project located <a href="https://github.com/kchelms/React_Practice--Physics_Sim">here</a>.
